🎓 I am a Software Developer with a Computer Science DEC degree from John Abbott College.

⛵ My hobbies include sailing which I have done for the past 11 years including as a coach.
Some other less hardcore hobbies are playing the guitar and playing video games.

📱 A project that I am currently working on is a device that helps on a sailing race. The user would be able to set the start line position
and the timer, then based on the boat speed a estimate of how long you will need to get to the line is shown. I had already made a mobile application for this and am now working on making a race legal version with a microprocessor and sensors.

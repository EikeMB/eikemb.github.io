üéì I am a Computer Science undegraduate student at Concordia University with a Computer Science DEC degree from John Abbott College.

‚õµ My hobbies include sailing which I have done for the past 11 years including as a coach. 
    Some other less hardcore hobbies are playing the guitar and playing video games.

üì± A project that I am currently working on is a mobile application that would act as a help device while sailing by allowing the user to input where the start line is and the app helps by giving a countdown to the line and how much times needs to be burned to get to the start line on time.

# Racing Help

## App Description

The racing help app is an app that allows the user to set a race start timer as well as the start line location. The app then by getting the boat heading, speed and location calculates the time to line and tells the user wether to slow down or speed up and by how much. This app was more of a prove of concept for a version using a device not a phone as the use of apps during the race is prohibited

## Technologies used

This app was made using flutter making use of several libraries such as the geolocation and compass libraries.

# Hour Logger App

## App Description

The hour logger app is a cross-platform app that allows a user to join or create an organization to which they can then log their work hours every day. This idea came to me out of necessity for a job in which the way the hours worked were being tracked was unecessarily hard.

## Technologies used

This app was made using Flutter and making use of firebase for authentication and database purposes.

# Hour Tracking Application 🕒

## App Description

A windows desktop app that allows the user to add and track hours they have worked.

The inspiration to create this application came when at my summer job there was no good way to keep track of hours as there was no clocking in method used.

This project was more of a proof of concept for me to see if I should spend time making it into a mobile app.

## Technologies used

This app makes use of C# WPF and SQL for the database connections.

### Pictures

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
    <img style="border:5px solid black;"  src="../images/HoursOpen.png" width="600">
    <img style="border:5px solid black;" src="../images/HoursMain.png" width="600">
    <img style="border:5px solid black;" src="../images/HoursMainWeekly.png" width="600">
    <img style="border:5px solid black;" src="../images/HoursAdd.png" width="300">
